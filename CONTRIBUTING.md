# Contributing #

**Contributions are highly encouraged and welcome**.
Bug fixes and clean ups do no need much coordination, but if you're interested
in contributing a feature, contact me at felixschlitter@gmail.com and we can
get the ball rolling &mdash; There's plenty to do. To get up and running, run:

```sh
npm i && bower i && npm test
```

NB: Purescript is declared a devDependency in package.json, so no need to bring
your own. Also, during development, `npm run watch` is extremely useful to get
immediate feedback.
